Generates SEO-optimized alt text and captions using article context and AI.

== Description ==

Most existing plugins simply "look" at the picture but don't understand its role in the article. Using surrounding text (context) is a "killer feature" for SEO, as it allows you to fit keywords as naturally as possible.

This plugin uses Google Gemini AI to analyze your content and images to generate:
*   High-quality Alt Text based on W3C standards.
*   Engaging Image Captions based on copywriting best practices.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/simple-alt-text-rewriter` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings -> Alt Text Rewriter and enter your Google Gemini API Key.
